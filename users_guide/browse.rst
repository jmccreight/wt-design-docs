The Tale Dashboard has four sections:

* **My Tales**: Tales you have created
* **Shared with Me**: Tales shared with you by other users
* **Public Tales**: Tales shared publicly by users of the system
* **Currenty running**: Displays if you have any interactive sessions running

My Tales
--------
The **My Tales** tab displays all tales that you have created or copied. You have 
edit permission on these tales and can delete them or share them with other users.

Shared with Me
--------------
The **Shared with Me** tab displays all tales that have been shared with you by
other users. These may be read-only or editable. If a tale is shared with you read-only,
when you attempt to run it a copy will be made and appear under My Tales with the
"COPY" indicator.

Public Tales
------------
The **Public Tales** tab displays all tales that have been shared publicly by
users of the system. These are all read-only. If you attempt to run a public tale,
a copy will be made and appear under My Tales with the "COPY" indicator.

Currently Running Tales
-----------------------
If you have clicked the **Run Tale** button for any tales, the **Currently Running**
panel will display. You may have 2 interactive environments running at the same time.
