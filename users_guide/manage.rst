File Management
===============

For each Tale, the **Files** tab allows you to manage any files or data
in the Whole Tale system including:

- Uploading data from your local machine
- Registering data from remote resources


Tale Workspace
--------------

The **Tale Workspace** folder is the primary storage area (or folder) for
all files associated with a Tale. 

Common operations include:

* Upload files or folders from your local machine
* Craete, rename, move, remove, copy, download files and folders
* Copy or move files between Tales

The **Tale Workspace** folder is also available in your running Tale environment 
as :code:`workspace`.


External Data
-------------
The **External Data** folder contains references to data you've registered in the system
for use with the tale. This data is meant to be read only and can only be added
from external sources. With this folder you can:

* Register data from external sources (e.g., via DOI or URL)
* Select and add registered data to a Tale

Supported Data Repositories
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The current supported repositories that you can register data from are 

  1. Zenodo_:
  A general purpose research data repository.

  2. Dataverse_:
  An open source research data repository platform with 35 installations
  worldwide including the flagship `Harvard
  Dataverse <https://dataverse.harvard.edu/>`_.

  3. Globus_:
  A service geared towards researchers and computing managers that allows
  custom APIs, data publication, and file transfer.

  4. DataONE_:
  A federation of data repositories with a focus on scientific data.
  A list of participating member nodes can be found on the member
  node `information page`_.


Adding Data
^^^^^^^^^^^
Files and folders cannot be uploaded to the **External Data** folder directly. To
encourage reproducibility, only data registered from external resources and
associated with a tale will be available in the **External Data** folder.

To register data from an external resource, use the data registration dialog,
shown below.

.. figure:: images/manage/data_registration_modal.png
     :align: center
     
     The data registration dialog allows you to search by DOI and ingest data
     into Whole Tale.
     
To access this dialog, navigate to the **External Data** folder by clicking the link icon
below the home directory folder.

     :align: center

     external sources.
     
The blue plus icon will open the registration dialog where you can find 
and register your data. You'll need to have either the DOI or data package URL
to find the data.

Adding Data From DataONE
""""""""""""""""""""""""
Data packages from DataONE_ can be integrated into Whole Tale by searching for
the DOI of the package or by pasting the URL into the search box in the 
registration modal.

**By DOI**

Consider the following package_. Visiting the package landing page we can
see that the DOI is "doi:10.18739/A29G5GD0V". To register this data package
using the DOI, open the registration dialog and paste the DOI into the
search box. Click "search" and check that the correct package was found.
Click "Register" to begin data registration. 

.. figure:: images/manage/dataone_doi.png
     :align: center

**By URL**

The URL of the data package can also be used to locate the package instead 
of the DOI. In the previous example, pasting 
"https://search.dataone.org/#view/doi:10.18739/A29G5GD0V" into the search box
will give the same data package which can subsequently be registered.

     url.
     

Adding Data From Dataverse
""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Whole Tale allows to register data from all 35 public Dataverse_ installations.
Support for additional installations can be added per user request. Similarly
to DataONE, data can be registered both by providing DOI or direct URL into the
search box of the registration modal.

**By DOI**

DOIs may be specified for either datasets or individual files. For example:

* Dataset: `doi:10.7910/DVN/TJCLKP <https://dx.doi.org/doi:10.7910/DVN/TJCLKP>`_
* File: `doi:10.7910/DVN/TJCLKP/BTRTVA <https://dx.doi.org/doi:10.7910/DVN/TJCLKP/BTRTVA>`_


**By URL**

URLs may be specified for either datasets or individual files using the web or
`Data Access API <http://guides.dataverse.org/en/latest/api/dataaccess.html>`_
formats.  For example:

* https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/TJCLKP
* https://dataverse.harvard.edu/file.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/TJCLKP/BTRTVA
* http://harvard.dataverse.edu/api/access/datafile/:persistentId/?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/TJCLKP/BTRTVA


Adding Data From Globus
"""""""""""""""""""""""

Data can also be retrieved from Globus by specifying the DOI of the package,
as done in the DataONE case.
 
**Supported Repositories**
 1. `Materials Data Facility`_

**By DOI**

The DOI of the dataset can be found on the dataset landing page. For example,
the `Twin-mediated Crystal Growth an Enigma Resolved`_ package has DOI
*10.18126/M2301J*. This DOI should be used in the data registration dialog when
searching for the dataset.

Adding Data From The Filesystem
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Files and folders cannot be uploaded to the **Data** folder directly. To
encourage reproducibility, only data registered from external resources or
associated with a tale will be available in the **Data** folder. The data can
however, be uploaded to the **Home** directory.

.. _home-folder:

Home Folder
-----------

The **Home** folder is your personal workspace in the Whole Tale system. You
can perform most common operations including uploading, creating, 
moving, renaming, and deleting files and folders.  

Your **Home** folder is mounted into every running tale instance with full
read-write permissions. This means that you can access and manage files from
both the Whole Tale dashboard and within tale environments. This is in contrast
to the **Data** folder described below, which is limited to read-only access.

Adding Data
^^^^^^^^^^^
Files on your computer can be uploaded to the **Home** folder by using the 
file selector dialog. To open the file selector, 

    1. Click on the **Home** directory
    2. Mouse over the blue addition symbol
    3. Select the **Upload** icon
