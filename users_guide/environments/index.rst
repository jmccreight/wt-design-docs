Computational Environments
==========================

In Whole Tale, an **Environment** is the operating system with a programming language and
any packages needed to run a computational workflow. When creating a tale, it is important
to pick the Environment that is right for your work. Whole Tale provides a set of base 
environments including Jupyter, RStudio, MATLAB, STATA and OpenRefine. You can customize
these environments by adding your own packages based on 
`repo2docker <https://repo2docker.readthedocs.io/>`_ compatible configuration files.
