	abstract = {In this paper we describe our experience adopting the Research Object Bundle (RO-Bundle) format with BagIt serialization (BagIt-RO) for the design and implementation of "tales" in the Whole Tale platform. A tale is an executable research object intended for the dissemination of computational scientific findings that captures information needed to facilitate understanding, transparency, and re-execution for review and computational reproducibility at the time of publication. We describe the Whole Tale platform and requirements that led to our adoption of BagIt-RO, specifics of our implementation, and discuss migrating to the emerging Research Object Crate (RO-Crate) standard.},

	abstract = {Whole Tale http://wholetale.org is a web-based, open-source platform for reproducible research supporting the creation, sharing, execution, and verification of "Tales" for the scientific research community. Tales are executable research objects that capture the code, data, and environment along with narrative and workflow information needed to re-create computational results from scientific studies. Creating reproducible research objects that enable reproducibility, transparency, and re-execution for computational experiments requiring significant compute resources or utilizing massive data is an especially challenging open problem. We describe opportunities, challenges, and solutions to facilitating reproducibility for data- and compute-intensive research, that we call "Tales at Scale," using the Whole Tale computing platform. We highlight challenges and solutions in frontend responsiveness needs, gaps in current middleware design and implementation, network restrictions, containerization, and data access. Finally, we discuss challenges in packaging computational experiment implementations for portable data-intensive Tales and outline future work.},
